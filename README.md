## Color-Map

Choose a color for a location point to color a map. This project is inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_(Reddit).

This project uses react.js, mapbox, and firebase.

#### Resources I used
- https://css-tricks.com/intro-firebase-react/
- https://github.com/firebase/geofire-js


#### TODO:
- validation on firebase for data (database.rules.json)
- mapbox
  - style points to zoom out with map
- geofire: upload changes to repo (maybe fork original and do changes to that one)
- clean files (comments and console logs and fix warnings)
- style footer
